# Newton MA School Desire Line Map

https://schools.newtonmoves.org/

This map shows shortest-path pedestian desire lines from Newton, Massachusetts residential addresses to their assigned elementary, middle, and high schools. 

## Notes
* Data comes from OpenStreetMap (OSM) walking routes and Newton GIS.
* Orange lines are streets that are part of routes between homes and schools. The thickness of the lines indicates the number of residences using this route as a shortest path.
* Blue circles are intersections. The size of each circle indicates how many routes cross through the intersection.
* Mousing over a line segment or a blue circle will show an "activity" number, which approximates a daily route count for that location. Activity numbers should be considered relative to each other and will not reflect actual trip numbers.
* Buffer zones between schools, where some addresses go to one school and some to another, include both routes.
* Routes are limited by length, depending on mode of travel:
    * Walk:
        * Elementary Schools: 0.75 miles or 1.2 km
        * Middle Schools: 1 mile or 1.6 km
        * High Schools:   1.25 miles or 2km
    * Walk and Bike:
        * Elementary Schools: 1 mile or 1.6 km
        * Middle Schools: 2.5 miles or 4 km
        * High Schools  3.5 miles or 5.6 km

* If distance circles are turned on, they show distances of 0.5 miles and 1 mile from the school.
* This map only represents potential routes and desire lines. It includes no information about where students actually live, or whether particular streets are good for walking or biking.
* In particular, the map does not necessarily show safe routes. It does not take into account crosswalks, crossing guards, the existence of sidewalks, or universal accessibility. For off-road paths, it does not account for snow clearance in winter.
* Residences in Chestnut Hill may not be correctly represented.
* Apartment and other multi-family dwellings are generally treated as single addresses. This is a limitation of Newton's GIS data.
* Additional entrances to schools may not be shown correctly on the map. Please report any additional access points to (m @ halle.us) so they can be added to the map.
